# Welcome to gtkdraw

This is an infinite canvas app written in `c` using gtk for illustrating ideas and planning projects.

## TODO

I've just started, so this would be the TODO list:

- Create basic code structure (vectors, lines, basic utility functions)
- Get basic drawing window set up
- Save as gtkdraw project (.gdw)
- Save as image feature (.bmp first, maybe .jpg or .png later)
