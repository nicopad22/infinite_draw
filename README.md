# Welcome to gtkdraw

This is an infinite canvas app written in `c` using gtk for illustrating ideas and planning projects, it allows you to draw in an infinite canvas where you can zoom in and zoom out a lot, and not lose any quality in the process, as this is *not* a pixel-based app like paint.

Yes, I know milton exists, but this was my attemt at making a similar thing, with my own way of making it, and my own features, etc. (plus, it should work on every OS that gtk3 supports, hasnt been tested though)

## TODO

- [x] Create basic code structure (vectors, lines, basic utility functions)
- [x] Get basic drawing window set up
- [x] Zoom towards mouse
- [x] Color drawing (+ selecting size)
- [ ] Save as gtkdraw project (.gdw)
- [ ] Save as image feature (.bmp first, maybe .jpg or .png later)
- [ ] Bookmarks
