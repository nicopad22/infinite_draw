# Welcome to gtkdraw

This is an infinite canvas app written in `c` using gtk for illustrating ideas and planning projects.

Yes, I know milton exists, but this was my attemt at making a similar thing, with my own way of making it, and my own features, etc.

## TODO

- [x] Create basic code structure (vectors, lines, basic utility functions)
- [x] Get basic drawing window set up
- [x] Zoom towards mouse
- [ ] Color drawing (+ selecting size)
- [ ] Save as gtkdraw project (.gdw)
- [ ] Save as image feature (.bmp first, maybe .jpg or .png later)
- [ ] Bookmarks
